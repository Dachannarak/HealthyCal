## 🧠 Project Overview
**HealthyCal** is a personalized health and lifestyle management application designed to support sustainable behavior change through an **Adaptive AI Recommendation System**.  
The project focuses on helping users manage daily health routines by providing context-aware and continuously adjusted recommendations tailored to individual lifestyles.

This project is developed as an academic and experimental prototype, emphasizing the application of AI concepts in real-world health management scenarios.

## 🚨 Problem Statement
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a major public health challenge, largely driven by inconsistent health behaviors rather than lack of awareness.  
While many health applications exist, most rely on **generic and static recommendations** that fail to adapt to:

- Stress levels  
- Sleep quality  
- Time constraints  
- User adherence patterns  

As a result, users often disengage when plans become unrealistic, leading to poor long-term outcomes.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
HealthyCal introduces an **Adaptive AI Recommendation System** that continuously learns from user behavior and adjusts health guidance in real time.

The system is designed to:
- Analyze behavioral patterns over time  
- Detect factors affecting adherence and performance  
- Adapt recommendations dynamically to match the user’s current condition  

For example, if a user consistently skips workouts due to fatigue, the system adjusts the plan by recommending lower-intensity activities or alternative schedules rather than repeating ineffective routines.
